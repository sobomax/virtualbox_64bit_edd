Usage:

  `basename $0` --help|--enable|--disable|--force-enable|--force-disable
                      |--remove [--prefix <prefix>]
                      -- <pass-through parameters>

Create a system service which runs a command.  In order to make it possible to
do this in a simple and portable manner, we place a number of requirements on
the command to be run:
 - That it can be started safely even if all its dependencies are not started
   and will sleep if necessary until it can start work.  Ideally it should
   start accepting input as early as it can, but delay handling it if
   necessary, and delay accessing its dependencies until it actually needs
   them.
 - That it does not background to simplify service process management.
 - That it can be safely shut down using SIGTERM.
 - That if all running copies of the main process binary are stopped first the
   service can be re-started and will do any necessary clean-up automatically.
 - That any output which must not be lost go either to the system log or to the
   service's private log.

We currently support System V init only.  This will probably soon be extended
to BSD init, OpenRC and systemd, but probably not Upstart which currently
requires modifying init files to disable a service.  We also try to enable our
service (if requested) in all init systems we find, as we do not know which one
is in active use.  We assume that this will not have any adverse effects.

 --help|--usage
     Print this help text and exit.

  --enable|--disable|--force-enable|--force-disable
      These actions install the service.  If a version of the service was not
      installed previously, "--enable" and "--force-enable" make it start when
      entering normal user run-levels and "--disable" and "--force-disable"
      prevents it from starting when entering any run-level.  If a version of
      the service was already installed previously, "--enable" and "--disable"
      simply update it without changing when it starts; "--force-enable" and
      "--force-disable" behave the same as when no previous version was found.
      Only one of these options or "--remove" may be specified.

  --remove
      This action uninstalls the service.  It may not be used in combination
      with "--enable", "--disable", "--force-enable" or "--force-disable".

Option:

  --prefix <prefix>
      Treat all paths as relative to <prefix> rather than /etc.

Pass-through parameters will be passed through to the "generate_service_file"
tool.
